In this semester I have a course named **simulation** .
I'm going to do the project here in this repo from the begining.
the project is simulating an encryption algorithm(Elgamal or Chebyshev) over a hypothetic network using ns-3.

I'm going to update here anything that I learn and code and any reference I find :

 - elgamal encryption     : [link](https://youtu.be/tKNY1zhK3sQ)
